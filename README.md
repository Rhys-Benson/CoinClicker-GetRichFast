# CoinClicker-GetRichFast
Simple clicker game

# Overview

This app is a simple clicker game, meant to help you fidget a little bit from time to time.
Sometimes you just need something mindless to do for a minute or two to give your brain a breather.
Sometimes fidgeting with something can help you focus your thoughts on a problem that's been bothering you.
Maybe you just enjoy the digital reward of clicking a button a lot of times.
Whatever your reason, anyone can enjoy Coin Clicker! It's surprisingly addicting.

I've created Coin Clicker in an attempt to further my own learning and abilities. Being able to create apps
has always interested me and this is my beginning. I decided on a clicker game because it was simple and it pays
homage to the silly yet strangely addictive clicker games I've experienced growing up.
